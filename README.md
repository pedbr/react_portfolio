### React Portfolio Challenge

As part of the 3rd week of the Craft Academy coding bootcamp we were faced with the challenge to create a portfolio where we can display our projects, work experience and information about ourselves, using JavaScript's library React.

After a brief design sprint, I opted to go for a simple design with a yellow and black strong contrast, where these two colors interchange on hovers in some elements.

The composition of the website is pretty straight forward. A home page with a welcome message, a projects tab where you can see a cards of all the projects I've created and links to their repositories, a Work tab where information about my education and working experience can be found, and finally a About Me tab where you have some information about myself and a contact button.

Both the Project and Work tabs are linked to JSON files that function like a data base where all the projects/work experiences are stored. Through this files we can easily edit, remove or add new elements without interfeering with the app's code.

This is a work in progress since I will be working on this project throughout the entire bootcamp and improve it with the new skills and knowledge I'll acquire.
